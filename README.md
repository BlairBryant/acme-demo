# Acme Demo

npm create-react-app was the only external tool used on this project.
I would have used SCSS for styling because I like the format better than standard css but the instructions said to not use any styling libraries.

## Running the application

Navigate to the acme-demo folder using your terminal.
Run the command 'npm start'
If Node and or npm are not installed on your computer, install them from here: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

## Additional Features
- Search functionality that can handle partial pieces of a name instead of requiring an exact match
- Filtering conversations based on whether or not they are flagged
